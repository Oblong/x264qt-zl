x264qt-zl
=========

This project is a fork of <a
href="http://developer.berlios.de/projects/x264qtcodec/">x264
QuickTime Codec</a>, updated to work with
a more recent <a href="http://git.videolan.org/?p=x264.git;a=summary">x264 code base</a>
(x264-snapshot-20120119-2245) [1] and reissued under
<a href="http://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-2.0.html">the (same) GPL</a> for your hacking pleasure.

Be advised that this little project takes two liberties (easily
changed by forking and recompiling):

  1. It is hardcoded to use the Zero Latency (real-time) setting
  because that is what I needed.

  2. It changes the four-cc code from 'avc1' to 'x264' in order to
  avoid a collision with the built-in OS X H.264 encoder.

Another caveat: this build is Intel-only, and I have only tested it on Snow Leopard.
